# THUI

This is a rudimentary GUI library with the goal of simplicity but with flexibility. Only basic widgets are included, Label, Button, Checkbox and Combobox. This should satisfy the majority of GUI needs but if you come up with a good case to include others let me know. All widgets can be themed with images for beautification. THUI is built around groups of GUI elements. Every group has a name, this name is used to activate (make visible) when you need it to. Only one group can be active at a time. THUI contains helper functions so that you can ensure the GUI will scale and look similar on different resolutions. The easiest way to layout a menu system is to create a script for each group, then apply the scripts to pivots in your level. If you wish to design it so, you can use the flow graph to control how the user navigates between groups. It is fairly straight forward to create your own widgets that don't look so bland.
